Example plugins for Solve for All

This repository contains the source code for the actual plugins by Solve for All used on the site. Pull requests for fixes, more features, and more plugins are very welcome! Also keep in mind you can upload your own plugins to Solve for All without our approval. (This is probably indispensible for testing, since we don't have a test harness yet.) You can also continue to run your own plugins and publish them to the the Solve for All community. 

If you want to make changes to the official Solve for All plugins (which more users are likely to have installed already), please submit pull requests.
